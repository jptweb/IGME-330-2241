First comment out the shadow stuff, and show how it changes everything

show one approach could be to reset everything each time (copy and paste the offset o mrever them back to zero)

Now show htem the approach of save() and restore() and the graphic


Next lets explore translate (there is a setTransform that does all three at once)
-translate
-rotate

Point out the issues we are running into with the traingle

Now lets try to do individual ones. Lets get rid of the gren and blue squares

Move the Good triangle to right below where we create yellow box.

Explain how it draws it with center point in origin

Try to move it around etc to demonstrate

Now lets do the same thing with the squares

Lets bring in the helper function.

Explain it briefly, put the calls right below the better triangle


Now lets animate:
rename init to loop

move context variable ctx out

Add request animation frame

NOW ITs spinng out of control! we need to save and restore!! 
ADD save() after // do some transformationss

add variable for rotating set = 0 script scopre

increment roation below request animationframe: rotation+=.05;

replace roation vairable in the ctx.rotate()

change valiue in drawsquare to so it uses the rotation variable too
